# idocs
This is a chrome extension which helps developers/users to search the document.

Dont you think default search is toooo hard to use?
Dont you think copy words to another page to search is tooooo complicated？
Maybe idocs can help.

After installed, fresh the old page or open new page to start.
Just select the content which you want to look up and double press the 'Alt' key。Now idocs provides 3 search engines and 2 languages, which you can config by click the icon.
